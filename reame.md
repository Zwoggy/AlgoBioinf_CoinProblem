# Algorithmic Bioinformatics: Coin Change Problem.

This project implements solutions to the coin change problem, a common problem in the field of Computer Science, specifically it falls under the Algorithmic Bioinformatics area. 

The program calculates the minimal number of coins using two algorithmic principles: the Greedy algorithm and Dynamic Programming. The project aims to compare the results obtained from each of these algorithms for different coin systems and return sums.

## How to Run

To run the script from your command line, navigate to the folder where your `main.py` file is located, and use the Python command followed by the file name:

## Coin Systems and Cases
This project includes four pre-set cases for coin systems and return sums. These are:

return_sum_1 = 77
coin_system_1 = {7, 3, 1}
return_sum_2 = 67
coin_system_2 = {6, 5, 4, 3}
return_sum_3 = 83
coin_system_3 = {50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1}
return_sum_4 = 83
coin_system_4 = {50, 25, 10, 5, 1}

Each of the return_sum_n and coin_system_n cases can be used independently as parameters to the greedy and dynamic functions.
